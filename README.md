# AIRO Simple Trajectoy 
This repo serves as an unified learning material for beginners in aerial robotics (quadrotor), in which a few basic trajectories have been provided. 
It is also legacy of [HKPolyU-UAV/px4-offboard](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/px4-offboard), [UAVNAV](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/uavnav) and [UAVCamel](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/uavcamel)

## The repo is still under construction
We plan to include the following:
- The basics: straight line, circles, lemniscate
- Minimum snap/jerk with naive time allocation
- Minimum snap/jerk with optimized time allocation (through gradient-decent method)
- Minimum snap/jerk with Bezier curve within safety corridor

To enrich the content, we also welcome any pull request outside the lab!
